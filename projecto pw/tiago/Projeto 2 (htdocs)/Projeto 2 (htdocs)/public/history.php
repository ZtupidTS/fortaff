	In the summer of 2012 London will host a Games like never before, drawing on the country’s proud Olympic heritage.
	London hosted the Olympic Games in 1908 and 1948. Each time, we left our mark on the Olympic Movement with our innovative approach.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>London 1908 Games</b><br/>
	<br/>
	<img style="float: left; border-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 11px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.2); border: 1px solid #E2E2E2; margin: 5px;" src="/pw606/img/1908-olympic-games-marathon-340x185.jpg" />The 1908 Olympic Games were originally awarded to Rome, but the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906 meant another Host City was needed. London stepped in and, despite the time constraints, the city’s offer to host the Games was accepted by the International Olympic Committee.<br/>
	<br/>
	The London 1908 Games were officially opened on 27 April 1908 by HRH King Edward VII and stretched out over a three-month period. A total of 22 nations sent 2,008 athletes – 1,971 men and 37 women – who competed across 110 events.
	<br/>
	The majority of the sports at London 1908 remain central to the Games today and will feature at London 2012. However, there were also those – including motor boating and tug of war – which have long since ceased to feature on the Olympic programme.<br/>
	<br/>
	When the Games closed on 31 October 1908, Great Britain topped the medal table with a total of 145 medals. The United States were second with 47, while third-placed Sweden claimed 25.<br/>
	<br/>
	Despite the short notice, the Games were widely declared a success and lay the foundations for London’s Olympic legacy as a Host City.<br/>
	<br/>
	<b>London 1948 Games</b><br/>
	<br/>
	<img style="display: inline; float: left; border-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 11px rgba(1, 1, 1, 0.2); border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;  margin: 5px" src="/pw606/img/london-1948-ceremony.jpg" />London again stepped in at the last minute to host the first Games after World War II. Despite a shortage of time and resources, the city rose to the challenge to host another fine, morale-boosting Games.<br/>
	<br/>
	The Opening Ceremony took place at Wembley Stadium on 29 July 1948, with HRH King George VI officially opening the Games. The Olympic Flame was lit by athlete John Mark, and the Olympic Oath taken on behalf of all competitors by Donald Finlay.<br/>
	<br/>
	136 events were contested by 4,104 athletes from 59 nations. At the end of the Games, the USA topped the medal table, taking away a total of 84 medals. They were followed by Sweden with 44, and France with 29.<br/>
